# What is digital electronics

DEFINATION:
Definition	Digital electronics is a branch of electronics that deals with digital signals — signals that have only two discrete levels: HIGH (1) and LOW (0). It is the foundation of computers, digital communication, and modern electronic devices.

# Applications of Digital Electronics

Applications	Used in:
• Computers, Laptops
• Digital Watches
• Mobile Phones
• Calculators
• Robotics
• Digital Control Systems
Applications	Found in almost all modern electronics: computers, smartphones, digital cameras, smart TVs, automotive systems, robotics, automation, and more.

# Digital vs Analog signals

| **Feature**                | **Digital Electronics**                                                  | **Analog Electronics**                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Signal Type**            | Discrete (two levels: 0 and 1)                                           | Continuous (infinite range of values)                                           |
| **Representation**         | Binary numbers (e.g., 101010)                                            | Voltage or current that varies smoothly over time                               |
| **Accuracy**               | High precision due to fixed logic levels                                 | Susceptible to noise and distortion, reducing accuracy                          |
| **Noise Immunity**         | High – digital signals are easily distinguished from noise               | Low – small noise can cause significant distortion                              |
| **Circuit Complexity**     | Can be complex in structure but easier to analyze and design using logic | Generally simpler circuits but harder to analyze due to varying signal behavior |
| **Data Storage**           | Easy and efficient (in binary format)                                    | Difficult and less reliable                                                     |
| **Examples of Components** | Logic gates, flip-flops, microcontrollers, FPGAs                         | Resistors, capacitors, transistors, op-amps                                     |
| **Signal Processing**      | Based on binary logic, uses processors and algorithms                    | Continuous-time processing, uses amplifiers, filters, and mixers                |
| **Conversion Required**    | Requires ADC/DAC to interface with the real world                        | No conversion needed for real-world analog signals                              |
| **Power Consumption**      | Generally lower (especially CMOS), though varies with speed              | Can be higher due to continuous operation                                       |
| **Application Examples**   | Computers, smartphones, calculators, digital watches, robotics           | Audio amplifiers, radio, analog sensors, old televisions                        |
| **Scalability**            | Highly scalable (integrated circuits, miniaturization possible)          | Less scalable for complex systems                                               |
| **Design Tools**           | Boolean algebra, logic circuits, HDLs                                    | Kirchhoff’s laws, differential equations, frequency analysis                    |
| **Reliability**            | More reliable due to error correction and immunity to signal degradation | Less reliable in long-distance transmission or noisy environments               |
| **Cost (Modern Era)**      | Often lower due to mass production and integration                       | May be higher in complex analog signal environments                             |

# LOGIC LEVELS 
In digital electronics, logic levels refer to the specific voltage ranges that represent binary states — typically 0 (LOW) and 1 (HIGH). These levels indicate how the digital system interprets voltages as logical TRUE (1) or FALSE (0).
# Logic Levels Table

| Logic Level | Digital Value | Voltage Range (Typical for TTL) | Voltage Range (Typical for CMOS) |
|-------------|---------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| LOW         | 0             | 0V to 0.8V                    | 0V to 1.5V                       |
| HIGH        | 1             | 2V to 5V                      | 3.5V to 5V (or 3.3V, depending)  |
| Undefined   | -             | 0.8V to 2V                    | 1.5V to 3.5V                     |


- LOGIC LEVELS

Logic 0 (LOW)

Logic 1 (HIGH)

- Digital circuits operate using only these two levels to interpret data, control operations, and perform computations.

# 1.Logic LOW (0)

- Logic 0, also called LOW, represents the binary value 0.



# 2.Logic HIGH (1)

- Logic 1, also called HIGH, represents the binary value 1.




# TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) – typically 5V system:

Logic 0 (LOW): 0V to 0.8V

Logic 1 (HIGH): 2V to 5V

Undefined Zone: 0.8V to 2V (should be avoided)


# CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) – flexible with V<sub>DD</sub>:


If V<sub>DD</sub> = 5V:


Logic 0: 0V to ~1.5V


Logic 1: ~3.5V to 5V


CMOS systems have higher noise immunity and can operate at lower voltages (e.g., 3.3V, 1.8V).


 # NUMBER SYSTEM

 A number system is a way to represent and express numbers using a set of symbols or digits. In digital electronics, number systems are used to represent data and perform calculations inside digital circuits and computers.

# Different number systems are BINARY, OCTAL,DECIMAL, HEXADECIMAL

| **Octal**      | 8    | 0–7                 | 75      | Compact representation of binary (3 bits)   |
| **Decimal**    | 10   | 0–9                 | 245     | Standard human-readable number system       |
| **Hexadecimal**| 16   | 0–9, A–F            | 3F      | Common in memory addresses and color codes  |

# Logic Notes

- **SUM** = A ⊕ B → using 7486 XOR gate

- Both ICs have 4 gates each; only 1 gate from each is used here.

# Logic Notes

- **SUM** = A ⊕ B ⊕ Cin → using 2 XOR gates from IC 7486
- **CARRY** = (A • B) + (Cin • (A ⊕ B)) → using 2 AND gates (IC 7408) and 1 OR gate (IC 7432)

Only 2 gates from XOR and AND ICs are used. Remaining gates can be left unconnected or tied off.

# IMPLEMENTATION OF 2X1 MULTIPLEXER

# Introduction
- A 2X1 Multiplexer (MUX) selects one of two inputs and forwards it to a single output.
- Control is based on a single **select line (S)**.
- This design uses basic gates from standard TTL ICs.


# How a 2X1 MUX Works – Step-by-Step
# It has 3 inputs:

A – Input 1

B – Input 2

S – Select line

It has 1 output:

Y – Output based on selected input

# Logic Operation:

If S = 0, the output Y = A

If S = 1, the output Y = B

- Internally:

- S = 0:

NOT(S) = 1

A is passed through an AND gate (A AND NOT(S))

B is blocked (B AND S = 0)

- S = 1:

NOT(S) = 0

A is blocked

B is passed through (B AND S)

The outputs of both AND gates go into an OR gate, so only the selected input reaches Y.


# Logic Expression
- Output Y = (A AND NOT(S)) OR (B AND S)
